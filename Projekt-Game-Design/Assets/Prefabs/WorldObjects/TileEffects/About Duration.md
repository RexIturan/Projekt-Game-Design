# Tile Effect Duration 

For better understanding the fields in the TileEffect-component. 

### Time until activation 
This defines how many TileEffect updates it takes, for the tile effect to activate. Notice that the update that activates the tile effect will NOT take any actions already. The first action will be taken on the next update after activation. 

### Time To Live 
This defines how often the tile effect will have an impact after activation. Setting it to 0 will cause the effect to never take any action.
